# The Relationship Between Eight Biomarkers and Exposure to Ozone and PM2.5


## Summary

A previous study was conducted to examine the association between ozone exposure and cardiopulmonary pathophysiologic mechanisms in 2017 Changsha, China. We have analyzed three more biomarkers in Changsha samples to compare the health effects of PM2.5 and ozone or both. There are R-markdown files of the code, and two folders, one is for the data, the other is for the output files in this repository. In the R-markdown files, I have wrangled and tidied the raw data, built full models for each biomarker and optimized them, then explored the correlation between pollutant exposure and biomarkers.
