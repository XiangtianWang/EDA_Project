# The Relationship Between Eight Biomarkers and Exposure to Ozone and PM2.5


## Summary

A previous study was conducted to examine the association between ozone exposure and cardiopulmonary pathophysiologic mechanisms in 2017 Changsha, China. We have analyzed three more biomarkers in Changsha samples to compare the health effects of PM2.5 and ozone or both. There are R-markdown files of the code, and two folders, one is for the data, the other is for the output files in this repository. In the R-markdown files, I have wrangled and tidied the raw data, built full models for each biomarker and optimized them, then explored the correlation between pollutant exposure and biomarkers.

## Keywords

Ozone; PM2.5; Exposure; Biomarker; Cardiovascular; linear regression model

## Database Information

The previous data are from two files "changsha_blood.csv" and "changsha_urine.csv" that contain the demographics data and average exposure data and the concentrations of 5 biomarkers. These two files are combined with our new experimental data of three biomarkers into the data file, "changsha_2020.csv".

## Folder structure, file formats, and naming conventions 

There are R-markdown files of the code, and two folders, one is for the data, the other is for the output pdf or jpeg files in this repository.

In the root folder, there are R-project and readme, and the R-markdown files.

In the "data" folder, there are CSV files that contain the raw and processed data.
In the "output" folder, there are output pdf and graphs generated by R.
 

I used the project name, function, and date as my naming conventions.

## Metadata
We have three csv data source, the changsha_urine and changsha_blood include the almost same variables except different biomarkers. In urine file has "ohdg" and "mda", in blood file has "psel","CRP",and "VWR". In our lab data file, we have three new biomarkers data.

Each column's description as below:

## Quality assurance/quality control

All the lab data follow the QA/QC in the lab.
Then mark all the below detection limit and the above detection limit as NA.  When we combined the three CSV files, "changsha_urine", "changsha_blood" and "changsha_2020", all the NA have been omitted. We have 306 available rows of data. Then we checked the normal distribution of the concentration of biomarkers. Each of eight biomarkers requires to transform into the logarithm. After the transformation, there are no obvious outliers. In this project, the significant statistics are default as p-value< 0.05.
